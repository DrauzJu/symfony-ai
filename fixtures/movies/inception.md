## Plot

A skilled thief is given a chance at redemption if he can successfully perform inception, the act of planting an idea in someone's subconscious.

**Dom Cobb** is a skilled thief who specializes in *extraction* - stealing secrets from people's subconscious minds while they dream. This unique skill has made him a valuable player in the world of corporate espionage, but it has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved.

Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible - **inception**. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime.

The film explores themes of *reality*, *dreams*, *memory*, and the nature of consciousness through multiple layers of dream states, creating a complex narrative structure that challenges both characters and audience to question what is real.
