## Plot

During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.

Billionaire **John Hammond** has created a theme park on a remote island where he has successfully cloned dinosaurs from ancient DNA found in prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber. Before opening to the public, Hammond invites a select group of people to tour the park, including paleontologist **Dr. Alan Grant**, paleobotanist **Dr. Ellie Sattler**, and mathematician **Dr. Ian Malcolm**.

The tour begins smoothly, but things quickly go wrong when the park's computer systems are sabotaged by the disgruntled programmer **Dennis Nedry**, who is attempting to steal dinosaur embryos. The security systems fail, and the dinosaurs break free from their enclosures.

As the island descends into chaos, the visitors must survive encounters with various dangerous dinosaurs, including the intelligent and deadly **Velociraptors** and the massive **Tyrannosaurus Rex**. Dr. Grant finds himself responsible for Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, as they attempt to reach safety.

The film explores themes of *scientific ethics*, the *hubris of trying to control nature*, and the *unintended consequences of genetic engineering*. It questions whether humans have the right to resurrect extinct species and whether scientific advancement should be pursued without considering the potential risks and moral implications.
